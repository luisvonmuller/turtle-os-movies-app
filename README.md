# Movies App
To run the App just type: 
$ npm run start. 

Theres a folder named firestore_populator that helped me to populated some placeholders, this should be ignored.

## If I had more time...
- I would write some tests for it, and give some kind of pagination to not surpass the daily rates of the firestore.
- Maybe I would give some further read on the FireStore documentation, since this was the first time using it, I wasn't able to find some conditional queries functions like the SQL %like% to search strings, then I did it via JS (since its a small data set).

### Other Comments.
I would make some web-browser cache as well, to not always fetch stuff from the firestore.
